This domain based approach is implemented easily but has some drawbacks in a SEO point of view: By using different domains for each language you automatically split up your site into several single sites. Each site will be handled separately by search engines. For example, they won't share the same page rank and backlinks. Using one domain and subfolders for each language may improve your site's overall ranking: All backlinks are connected to your top level domain.

Normally all these files are located somewhere in the assets subfolder of your MODx root directory. When including an asset via a relative URL like assets/css/style.css the asset won't be found:</p> <ol> <li>The browser will try to request something like    https://\u200bwww.\u200bexample.com/en/assets/css/style.css because the site's URL    https://\u200bwww.\u200bexample.com/en/ (defined via the <code>site_url</code> context setting in step    2) is used to handle relative URLs.</li> <li>The rewrite rule from above will be applied and the request will be     internally forwarded to    https://\u200bwww.\u200bexample.com/index.php?cultureKey=en&amp;q=assets/css/style.css</li> <li>MODx won't find any resource matching the alias assets/css/style.css and will    return a 404 error code.</li> </ol> <p>To solve this problem you have to add another rewrite rule before the rule from above which internally redirects all request to /[ck]/assets/ to /assets/ where [ck] is a valid culture key:</p> <pre><code>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteRule ^(en|de)/assets(.*)$ assets$2 [L,QSA]\n</code></pre> <p>Fine! Now you can use relative links for your pages and assets. Including images with TinyMCE should work, too.</p> <p>You may want to add some additional rewrite rules for other files which are being referred via relative URLs. For example the favicon.ico in your root directory:</p> <pre><code>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteRule ^(en|de)/favicon.ico$ favicon.ico [L,QSA]\n</code></pre> <p>Other languages</p> <p>If you're using other languages than German and English you have to change the (en|de) part of the rewrite rule according to your needs. For example for a website available in English, Spanish and French you can use the following favicon rewrite rule:</p> <pre><code>RewriteRule ^(en|es|fr)/favicon.ico$ favicon.ico [L,QSA]\n</code></pre> <p>Additionally, the server can automatically determine the language when the domain root https://\u200bwww\u200b.example.com/ is requested and perform a redirect to the suitable language version in the following way:</p> <ul> <li>When the accepted language is not German (de) and the root has been   requested (relative request URI is empty) redirect to the English version   (en): see first condition and rewrite rule from below (line 2 and 3).</li> <li>Otherwise, redirect to German version (de) when the root has been requested:   see second rewrite rule from below (line 4).</li> </ul> <pre><code># detect language when requesting the root (/)\nRewriteCond %{HTTP:Accept-Language} !^de [NC]\nRewriteRule ^$ en/ [R=301,L]\nRewriteRule ^$ de/ [R=301,L]\n</code></pre> <p>Only rudimentary rules</p> <p>That's very rudimentary. The condition only checks whether the value of the Accept-Language HTTP header variable begins with the language (culture) key. But this variable contains much more than only a language key: It's a list of preferred (or even non-preferred) keys like this: Accept-Language: de-de,de;q=0.8,en-us;q=0.5,en;q=0.3. The q variable specifies the importance of the language from 0 to 1. Detecting the language with PHP in the gateway plugin is much better. But this is not the topic of this article and will be discussed in another post.</p> <p>Ok now all rules and conditions can be added to your .htaccess file. It's very important to place them in the right order before <code># The Friendly URLs part</code> because Apache goes through the rules from top to bottom:</p> <pre><code># detect language when requesting the root (/)\nRewriteCond %{HTTP:Accept-Language} !^de [NC]\nRewriteRule ^$ en/ [R=301,L]\nRewriteRule ^$ de/ [R=301,L]\n\n# redirect all requests to /en/favicon.ico and /de/favicon.ico\n# to /favicon.ico\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteRule ^(en|de)/favicon.ico$ favicon.ico [L,QSA]\n\n# redirect all requests to /en/assets* and /de/assets* to /assets*\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteRule ^(en|de)/assets(.*)$ assets$2 [L,QSA]\n</code></pre> <p>If you'd like to go deeper into defining rewrite rules you should read more about the Apache mod_rewrite module.</p>"},{"location":"usage/tutorial-seo/#is-this-approach-optimal","title":"Is this approach optimal?","text":"<p>This solution works fine and editors can work as they did before without caring about relative links and subfolders.

If you have worked through the documents listed above and installed a new clean MODx environment you should be ready to set up your multilingual website.</p> <p>I\u2019ll go through all the necessary steps by configuring an example website which will be available in three languages: English, German and French. The English site will be available via www.\u200bexample.com the German site via www.\u200bexample.de and the French one via www.\u200bexample.fr.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Create your contexts for each language:The default web context will    be used for the English site, a de context for the German and a fr context for    the French site:</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Configure language specific settings of all your contexts: <code>site_url</code> and <code>cultureKey</code>.</p> </li> <li>web context: <code>site_url</code>: https://\u200bwww.\u200bexample.com, <code>cultureKey</code>: en</li> <li>de context: <code>site_url</code>: https://\u200bwww.\u200bexample.de, <code>cultureKey</code>: de</li> <li> <p>fr context: <code>site_url</code>: https://\u200bwww.\u200bexample.fr, <code>cultureKey</code>: fr</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Grant the \"Load Only\" access policy for all your contexts to the anonymous    group to let your users load the contexts.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Install a routing extra from the MODX repository, i.e. SmartRouting, xRouting    or LangRouter via the MODX package management</p> </li> <li> <p>Install the Babel Extra via package management.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Now you should be able to create documents and link translations via Babel in your MODx manager. For information about how to use the MODx lexicon feauture you may take a look at the tutorial at digital butter or official documentation.</p>"},{"location":"usage/tutorial/#common-mistakes","title":"Common Mistakes","text":"<p>In order to avoid mistakes during setting up your contexts here are some common mistakes which have been made by users who requested my help:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Babel does not display the correct language of a context   You may have forgotten to configure the cultureKey setting in the specific context. Babel uses this setting to determine the language of a context.</p> </li> <li> <p>Babel does not display all links to translated documents in the front-end   You may have forgotten to grant the \"Load Only\" access policy for your visitors to the specific contexts.
