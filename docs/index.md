# Babel

Babel is an Extra for MODx Revolution that helps you to manage your multilingual
websites using different contexts. Babel even supports managing several
different multilingual websites within one MODx instance by using so-called
context groups.

Babel maintains links between translated resources. In the manager you can use
the Babel Box to easily switch between the different language versions of your
resources. Translations can be created automatically by Babel or defined
manually.

Additionally, Babel can be used to synchronize certain template variables (TVs)
of translated resources which should be the same in every context (language).

### Requirements

* MODX Revolution 2.8+
* PHP 7.4+

### Features

* Babel Button on the resource page for creating, linking and updating
  translated resources in different contexts
* Custom manager page for maintaining links between translated resources
