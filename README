Babel is an Extra for MODx Revolution that helps you managing your multilingual
websites using different contexts. Babel even supports managing several differnet
multilingual websites within one MODx instance by using so called context groups.

Bable maintains links between translated resources. In the manager you can use 
the Babel Box to easily switch between the different language versions
of a resource. Translations can be created automatically by Babel or defined 
manually.

Additionally Babel can be used to synchronize certain template variables (TVs)
of translated resource which should be the same in ervery context (language).
